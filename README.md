# cudoku

Usage: make && ./cudoku \[-h\]

### Todo:
* `solver.c`: if we write value x, and note mode is off, 
ensure every note with value x in the same row, column and block are erased.
* Make the borders in bold text for every block (3x3 cells).
* Make constant numbers in another color do make it easier to 
differentiate them from user inputed numbers.
